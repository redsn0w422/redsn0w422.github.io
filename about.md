#Hi, it's Yasha

I'm currently a student at UIUC studying computer science and working as a systems intern at State Farm. Right now, I enjoy developing for the web,
but I hope to expand my reaches within the near future.

I joined a small research team and published [a paper](/img/paper1.pdf) about our
supercomputer analytics tool this past semester.

Before I forget, [here's my resume.](/img/resume.pdf)

##Here are some past projects:

1. [3DSnap](http://github.com/redsn0w422/boilermake2015/)
| Snapchat-like app for 3D snapchats. Supports 3DS and mobile phones using [Google Cardboard.](http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/)

2. [Personal Site](https://github.com/redsn0w422/redsn0w422.github.io/)
| Code for this page. Trying out both my own site using vanilla everything, but also trying Jekyll.

3. [InternetKarma](http://github.com/xasos/InternetKarma/)
| App that calculates Internet "Karma" by aggregating likes across Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Github, and Instagram; built using Node.JS

4. [ScandIn](http://github.com/xasos/ScandIn)
