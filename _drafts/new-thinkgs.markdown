I've wanted to blog for a _while_.

a few days ago, I finally set up [this](http://blog.yashamostofi.com/) page
all because I found out that `.xyz` domains were only $1, so I bought ymostofi.xyz
and needed something to throw up. I whipped together a jekyll page, threw it on
github static pages, and now here I am, **blogging.** at 3 am.

#blogging, at 3 am

so for all potential readers - here are some, uh, ground rules
as to what you can, and cannot expect from my blogging:

###1. I am not a particularly good writer.

I always have struggled with writing in the past,
and this blog will be no exception. expect plenty of grammar errors,
poor word choice, and other face-palm moments

###2. I do, however, enjoy describing my ideas.

I've always loved telling people my ideas, but joining [ICDA](http://www.edline.net/pages/ICDA)
(our debate team) in high school emphasized that trait.
I figured this blog would serve as a collection of my thoughts, both short and long.

###3. there will be no consistency.

well, actually, I'll try to use lowercase as much as possible.
other than that, expect no consistency in terms of content, length,
formatting, and most importantly, some resemblance of a schedule.
I'll post stuff when I want to, whenever my course load drops a bit.
and don't forget - the lack of content consistency will be surprising.
some days I might talk about philosophy or ethics, and other days I'll blog
about some new JavaScript framework or `code`.

###4. I like lowercase letters.

sorry.


##so yeah.

here's my blog, and with it, my thoughts. I hope you enjoy.
