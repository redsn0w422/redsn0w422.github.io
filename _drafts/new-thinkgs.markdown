#microsoft's back.

they recently announced the [surface book](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/devices/surface-book), which **really** excites me.

this means that apple's macbook pro's are finally facing some competition, and,

##competition drives innovation.

I look forward to buying my next laptop.
