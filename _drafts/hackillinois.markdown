# This year,
HackIllinois 2016 was scheduled for the weekend of February 19-21.
Since I'm a seasoned Hackathon Hacker, I decided to join staff for our own hackathon and catch a glimpse into what it takes to runone of the best hackathons in the Midwest. The weekend before the event, we had a staff picnic, so that we could get together and make sure all of our plans were set in motion (and get our fancy staff jackets).

## Our last staff meeting was
the wednesday before, involved stuffing over 1200 swag bags for the hackers. In the bag, we gave out plenty of sponsor swag and some HackIllinois swag as well, including Facebook socks, a cool GitHub sticker, a metal HackIllinois-branded cup, a bottle of [Soylent](http://www.soylent.com), some HackIllinois stickers, and some other stuff as well.

## My Friday began with coffee and homework.
(Spoiler: I didn't finish the assignment...)


The rest of the day involved setting up rooms, banners, tables, etc. in the two buildings we were using for the event. Rather than going into much detail, I think this screenshot describes that day rather well:
