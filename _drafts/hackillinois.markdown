# This year,
HackIllinois 2016 was scheduled for the weekend of February 19-21.
Since I'm a seasoned Hackathon Hacker, I decided to join staff for our own hackathon and catch a glimpse into what it takes to run one of the best hackathons in the Midwest. The weekend before the event, we had a staff picnic, so that we could get together and make sure all of our plans were set in motion (and get our fancy staff jackets).

## The Wednesday before,
our last staff meeting, involved stuffing over 1200 swag bags for the hackers. In the bag, we gave out plenty of sponsor swag and some HackIllinois swag as well, including Facebook socks, a cool GitHub sticker, a metal HackIllinois-branded cup, a bottle of [Soylent](http://www.soylent.com), some HackIllinois stickers, and some other stuff as well.

## My Friday began with coffee and homework.
(Spoiler: I didn't finish the assignment...)


The rest of the day involved setting up rooms, banners, tables, etc. in the two buildings we were using for the event. Rather than going into much detail, I think this screenshot describes that day rather well:

## We laid out _a lot_ of snacks.

## Friday

After a full day of running around, the majority of my night involved manning the Siebel "Help Desk." Both buildings had a desk manned with at least one staff member the entire event, so that someone could handle any emergencies hackers had (more on that in the Saturday section) or just making sure the event runs smoothly in general. Since Friday was the first night, we had plenty of late arrivals checking in. I had the unfortunate responsibility of informing the hackers of whatever we had ran out of most recently (swag bags, t-shirts, lanyards...) and get them fed as fast as possible. We also had a **lot** of volunteers during the weekend, and they also were checking in every four hours or so, and needed things to do. And, of course, sponsors needed to be checked up on, to make sure they weren't missing anything at all, like power strips, adapters, cables, water bottles, etc.

I also ventured downstairs to the basement whenever food arrived, to organize the hackers into lines and make sure everyone was aware of the meal options, and what they needed

## Even though the weekend was great, this was the best part:
