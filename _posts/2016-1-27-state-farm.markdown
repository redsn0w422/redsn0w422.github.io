# State Farm, My 2nd Semester

My second semester at UIUC started on January 19th.
While classes weren't scheduled on that Monday, I did have to attend 5 hours of 
onboarding/training for my spring 2016 internship: a systems intern at State Farm.


## Research Park

State Farm is headquartered in Bloomington, IL, but operates a satellite office in Champaign, IL 
as part of [Research Park.](http://researchpark.illinois.edu) Other companies in the Park
include Yahoo, Agrible, AkunaCapital (which you can read about [here]({{ site.url }}/life/2016/01/25/akuna-capital.html)), Caterpillar, and John Deere. The office I work out of is called the Research and Development Center.
Essentially, Research Park companies hire talent like students - both undergrad and graduate - and faculty with
the goal of building new technology. 


I snaapped a few pictures of the Park on my walk from the bus stop.
