I've wanted to blog for a _long time_.

A little while back, I finally set up this page.
I whipped together a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) page, threw it on
[GitHub Static Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and now here I am, **blogging.**.

#blogging, at 3 am

So for all potential readers - here are some things I'd like to clear up:

###1. I am not a particularly good writer.

I always have struggled with writing in the past,
and this blog will be no exception. expect plenty of grammar errors,
poor word choice, and other face-palm moments.

###2. I do, however, enjoy describing my ideas.

I've always loved expressing my ideas, but joining [ICDA](http://www.edline.net/pages/ICDA)
(debate team) in high school really brought that to life.
I figured this blog would serve as a collection of my thoughts, both short and long.

###3. There will be no consistency.

Expect no consistency in terms of content, length,
formatting, and most importantly, some resemblance of a schedule.
I'll post stuff when I want to, whenever my course load drops a bit, or I
find myself enjoying some excellent coffee.
